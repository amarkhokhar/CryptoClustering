# CryptoClustering

The CryptoClustering challenge assignment focuses on k-means and principal component analysis to analyze data that relates to crypto coins and price change data over period of times. 

The first half of the assignment uses standard scaling and k-means models to create an elbow plot and scatterplot that will help inform users of what the most ideal clusters would be for the analyzed and modeled data. 

The second half of the assigment uses standard scaling and principal component analysis and modeling to help inform users make decisons on crypto data of various coins and prices changes over time. 

In both models, a k-means of 4 (in terms of the elbow plot) indicate the best k-means for clustering. However, lower clustering values 0-2 show the best clustering data.
